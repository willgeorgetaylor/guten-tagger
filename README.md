# Guten Tagger
## A simple 'error tagger' for German language gap-fill exercises. ##
Error tagging is the process of identifying, classifying and representing types of linguistic 'errors', or non-standard features, in natural and (often) non-natively authored texts. Guten Tagger is designed to tag errors in very short (1-20 words) written inputs by learners of the German language, by applying a 'generative' approach to the task. Thanks to the prescribed set of acceptable inputs in most online exercises, Guten Tagger successfully demonstrates that an exhaustive set of incorrect inputs can be found for each, and tagged with its grammatical properties.
